	    		As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div meets 
	    		the .jpg background. I used the <br/> same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used
	    		in the HTML?
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float 
	    		Drop when I resize <br/> (reduce) the browser window.I think that is what "display:inline;/* 
	    		stops IE doubling margin on float" is for, but <br/> would like further explaination to understand
	    		this comment. 
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be separate version
	    		wrappers as <br/> we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhabs this is an
	    		example of an inner div as the <br/> book suggest? I am still confused on that detail.
	        </p>
			<p>
				Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div,the page still huggs the left side?
				I`ve tried it in all of <br/> them, but it wont`t budge?			
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously, this footer has a mind of it`s own...it`s in the wrapper,but the "clear" seems to
				be allowing it outside. <br/> However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?
